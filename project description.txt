Body parser()
http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html

limit
Controls the maximum request body size. If this is a number, then the value specifies the number of bytes; 
if it is a string, the value is passed to the bytes library for parsing. Defaults to '100kb'.

extended
The extended option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when false) or
the qs library (when true). The “extended” syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded 
format, allowing for a JSON-like experience with URL-encoded. For more information, please see the qs library.

and allow us to use the state or store from anywhere in the project

it does a action or changes a state of the store

action creators are function that create actions

hooks used in redux
